# WahooToGarmin

This project follows the suggested multi-module setup and consists of the `desktop`, `mobile` and `core` subprojects.
The shared build logic was extracted to a convention plugin located in `buildSrc`.

This project uses a version catalog (see `gradle/libs.versions.toml`) to declare and version dependencies
and both a build cache and a configuration cache (see `gradle.properties`).
